# Hello-World
Practice Redo 2018
Hello there!

Last year I began the journey to teach myself how to code...and then I didn't follow through.
As I enter the last year of my 20s, I made a decision to commit to things that not only allow me 
to be more creative, but to also become a well-rounded working professional!
